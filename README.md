## INTRODUCTION
#### My name is Lucas Constanza,and I am in 10th grade. I enjoy playing sports, drawing and spending time with others. For each activity I mostly enjoy listening to music while doing them.

## SUMMER ACTIVITIES
#### Over summer, I partook in many games of basketball at random parks and soccer too sometimes. I also traveled to my motherland, New Jersey, and New York. I also went to the beach a few time and enjoyed the freezing ocean water. Most of my summer I worked on drawings and art projects I do to keep myself distracted or to have somehint to do.

## SUMMER TRAVEL EXPERIENCES
#### During summer I went on a vacation to my motherland, Guatemala. There I stayed with a family member and visited many citues and attractions the country has to offer. While going from city to city, I tried many delicious foods and beverages that I wish existed here. I also visited my grandparents that I havenÂ´t seen in almost a decade. I stayed for a week and a half and plan to go back next summer.

## MY GOALS
#### My goals for this semester is to pass all of my classes with nothing under a B. I want to be responsible this year and set my priorities straight. I will stop procrastinating, get more sleep, worry less about relationships, get good grades on tests, do homework, get to class on time, pay attention in class, get my work done quick and easy, prepare well for the AP exams, and pass them.
